## New Vision Statement 
# December 17 2024

For our team's project, we made an app which help students and memebers of larger communities in a university find events and activities around campus, get involved and join communities that interest them. We delivered an app that aims to connect communities through events of all diferent typesâ€” sports, student organizations, food, workshops, and other. 

At Calvin University and other universities, EventSphere will help reduce the amounts of poster boards posted in bulletin boards, emails, and other types of events marketing. This go-to app makes looking for events and marketing events more convenient and easier to use than constantly going through the different places. 


## Usage

To use the EventSphere app, follow these steps:

1. Create an account or log in with your existing credentials.
2. Browse the home page to see the list of upcoming events.
3. Click on an event card to view more details, edit, or delete the event.
4. Use the search bar to filter events based on names, organizers, locations, or tags.
5. Create a new event using the "Create Events" page.
6. Save events to your profile by clicking the bookmark icon on the event card.

## Features

- A home page where event cards show up. You can search events in the search bard based on Event names, Event Organizers, Event Locations, Event tags.
- The events card in the home page are designed to be clicked on; Once clicked, it shows more descriptions about the events and it also show edit and delete buttons for the event clicked. Also there is a bookmark icon on the events card and once clicked the cards that are saved also display in another page called Saved Events. 
- There is also a Create Events page where it walks users through making an event. Each event made by a user also appears in the users profile page.
- A saved events page where all events that are a saved by users are displayed. 

## Future Work

There are some features that have been started but have not yet been finished and that we would like to work more in the future:
- A communities page: where users can find communities to join and enjoy. Communities can be as anything as a small group or a big student organization. 
- We would also like to add security, so fake events are not spamed into users' home pages.
- An RSVP button that counts how many users are going to attend an event. 

These features and functions help people find their community and become a reliable source of club/org-related news for members with the goal of making fostering community.
