# EventSphere Vision Statement
### Team F, the fun team
### Danyeol Chae, Sungmin Choi, Brian Huynh, YoungHa Kweon, HaDong Park

For our team’s project, we hope to make an app that students in a university can use to help them find events/activities around campus, get involved, and join
communities. We hope to develop an app for students or members of larger communities to help them get better connected to their community through events of all different
types. We hope that the app will be able to show users all events going on around campus, including all student organizations, clubs, sports, individual events, and more. 
While events are announced on the Calvin website, poster boards, emails, and other methods, having a go-to app thats more convenient and easier to use than constantly going 
through the different places would be nice. 


This app will have more features than a simple list that already exists. We hope to be able to implement features such a: distinguishing the category of events to be able 
to find the ones you will enjoy, map/ location to be able to find the event venue, sub-communities to send event details only to members of organizations/ clubs, and more. 
These functions will help people find their community and become a reliable source of club/org-related news for members. 
 

 We hope to be able to implement features so that clubs can use the app to announce their events to the users of the app/ students in the university to get people to know 
 about them and join or even for club/ organization leaders to announce their events to their members. Individuals can also use this feature to get people together to do 
 something more spontaneous such as organizing a pickup sports games or getting people together for a movie somewhere. Overall, the app’s goal is to be the main source of news/ advertising for events around the campus, so that students can go through and see what is happening around 
 campus all in one app, making things easier for leaders and members.
 
 # Updated Vision Statement:
 Our vision is to make an app that aims to connect university students with campus events, activities, and communities, making it easier for them to stay informed and get involved. It will centralize event information from clubs, organizations, sports, and spontaneous activities in one user-friendly platform. Students can easily find events based on interests like clubs, sports, or social activities. Events will be integrated with campus maps to help users find venues easily. Clubs can post events and notify members directly. Users can create and share informal events like pickup games or social gatherings. The app will filter events based on users' interests. Push notifications and calendar sync to help students remember upcoming events. Clubs can send event details to only their members, ensuring relevant notifications. The app’s goal is to be the go-to platform for discovering and managing campus events, helping students find community and stay connected with what’s happening around them.
