Team F, the fun team

	For our team’s project, we hope to make an app that students in a university can use to help them find events/activities around campus and get involved and join communities.
	We hope to be able to implement features so that clubs can use the app to announce their events to the users of the app/ students in the university to get people to know about them and join or even for club/ organization leaders to announce their events to their members. Individuals can also use this feature to get people together to do something more spontaneous such as organizing a pickup sports games or getting people together for a movie somewhere.
	Overall, the app’s goal is to be the main source of news/ advertising for events around the campus, so that students can go through and see what is going on around campus all in one app which would make things easier for leaders and members.
	The customers would be everybody, isolated more into groups (e.g. Universities)
 


 
 ************** TO FIX ***************	
Your vision statement has some useful material, but I suggest that you follow the template given in the elevator-test article:
    - In the first paragraph, start by identifying your customer and describing their needs. Then, you can explain how your system will help meet those needs. The key question here is to identify the problems we currently have with event lists.
    - In a second paragraph, compare your system with other similar systems and explain why yours is better. The key question here is how your app could be better than a simple event list, which we already have.
 	
- Here are some suggestions for cleaning up the presentation:
    - Use a meaningful title.
    - Move that last sentence to the front, and make it more clear, e.g., who's "everybody"? what's "isolation"?
    - Get the Markdown formatting working properly (e.g., paragraph font, lists, headers). I had to cut and past this text into a local text file just to read it.
    - We suggest putting an alphabetized list of team members after the vision statement.
