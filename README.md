	For our team’s project, we hope to make an app that students in a university can use to help them find events/activities around campus and get involved and join communities.
	We hope to be able to implement features so that clubs can use the app to announce their events to the users of the app/ students in the university to get people to know about them and join or even for club/ organization leaders to announce their events to their members. Individuals can also use this feature to get people together to do something more spontaneous such as organizing a pickup sports games or getting people together for a movie somewhere.
	Overall, the app’s goal is to be the main source of news/ advertising for events around the campus, so that students can go through and see what is going on around campus all in one app which would make things easier for leaders and members.
	The customers would be everybody, isolated more into groups (e.g. Universities)
